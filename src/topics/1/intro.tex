    \section{TOPIC 1 - Introduction}
    The topic aims to aid you on how to comprehend the different applications that's based on what you study
    in the course\cite{ELCN405}.\\

    The topic mentioned the difference between \textbf{Guided Propagation} and \textbf{Unguided Propagation}.\\
    The topic also included a charter with the various frequency band applications. \\

    The topic is very brief, and introductory that ends up with those main takeaway points that either
    describe the course\cite{ELCN405} or introduce to real life examples, that are unlikely to be presented
    as a question in the exam. \\

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Introduction to Antennas and Radiation Mechanism
        \item Radiation Integrals
        \item Basic Antenna Parameters
        \item Types of Antennas
        \item Antennas in Receiving Mode
        \item Antenna Arrays
        \item Microwave Link Design
    \end{itemize}

    These conclude all the topics to be covered in the course\cite{ELCN405}
